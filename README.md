pygame-tetrominoes
==

Pygame tetromino game I poured plenty of hours into. Intended to one day be ported to the HP Prime Graphing Calculator, but this idea has been set aside (for now).

The default language was originally Russian; I used Google Translate to create all this Russian text for the game as I do not know the language. I did it because the original concept for the game was invented in Russia, and I wanted it to feel more traditional at first. However, I removed the Russian language for reasons detailed by selecting "protestware info" under the main menu.

This game was originally called "обычный клон тетриса" which means "ordinary Tetris clone" in Russian, but I renamed it due to potential copyright issues. I probably would have been fine though.

Due to this game being hard to maintain, the project has essentially died.
